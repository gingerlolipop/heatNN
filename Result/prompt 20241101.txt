I have an Excel file listing articles with links to their ArXiv pages. I want you to review their full text, and provide a synthesized table that checks if each article meets my screening criteria, specifically: 1) Published between 2014-2024, 2) relevance to these research questions:

How effective are machine learning models in accurately forecasting heatwaves and other climate extremes?
What factors influence their performance across different regions and climates?
What training data and climate/weather features do the best models use?

3) Written in English. 
In the table, please include columns for:
